On Hypotenuse AI, brands can store their product data, and have AI agents fill in missing details, edit their product images and write their content.\n\nHypotenuse AI is a Singapore-born startup impacting the entire ecommerce industry globally, with customers ranging from brands like Billabong and Crunchyroll to some of the largest department stores in US and Canada.\n\nWe’re backed by top global investors like Y Combinator, January Capital and executives from Amazon, Shopback and other VCs/angels, and have an experienced team of hard-hitters with a background in AI research, ecommerce and top startups. Join us if you want to be part of the journey as we build a generational company reshaping AI & ecommerce!\n\nThe role\nWe’re looking for an experienced full stack engineer to join us as we scale and reshape how ecommerce brands work. We handle large amounts of data (millions of product records per customer), across many brands, and are constantly onboarding new customers fast—scaling up what we do is a key priority in this role.\n\nWe don’t want code monkeys. In this role, you’ll be extremely hands on, spending the bulk of time rapidly building features, fixes and improvements, while working on a high level: scaling infra, architecting/designing new components and thinking about the product.\n\nHere are some examples of the types of problems that teammates in this role work on:\ndesigning and implementing a new image generation workflow and feature from start to end\norchestrating and engineering context around AI models/LLMs to maximize performance (output quality, speed and reliability)\noptimizing database queries or frontend components to reduce generation time from X to Y\nrapidly shipping and iterating on new and core features\nscaling up our infrastructure to be able to handle high concurrency, high volume asynchronous jobs so it can handle a load of X in Y time\ninfluencing our current engineering practices and constantly improving them to increase dev speed, reduce bugs, improve code practices etc.\n\nYou’ll work on features and applications that push the frontier of what’s possible today, setting the groundwork and solving problems from first principles to reshape how ecommerce brands work as an industry.\n\nTo achieve that level of impact, we work intensely and move fast. Expect new features every few days. Expect hard work, long hours. Expect to build things that no one has done before. We thrive on speed and precision, coupled with a whole lot of new technology.\n\nSound like you?\nWe want engineers who can thrive in a startup; able to work in an extremely fast-paced environment, and can truly drive building features from scratch. We’re looking for engineers who:\n\nOwn things end-to-end: we’re a startup. You aren’t here to just receive instructions. We want you to be a thinker and driver. Play a part in figuring out the features to build, the architecting of it, and driving it all the way to customer impact.\nObsess over problems: if you love to dig deep into architecture and scaling issues, optimize queries, figuring out tricky bugs; if you obsess and have a constant curiosity to dig deep and learn, then we are your tribe.\nAre product minded: you think beyond just code. You understand the customer, problem statements, and are able to drive impact on a product-level. Bonus if you love interacting directly with users.\n\nNot all of the following are strict requirements, but experience and a strong foundation will help a long way:\nYou've designed and built backend architectures (i.e. experience with AWS, designing APIs, components, database optimizations etc..), often needing to handle large amounts of data and concurrent or asynchronous jobs\nYou're familiar with software engineering best practices (testing, logging/monitoring, deployments, event tracking etc..) and have worked with large codebases before\nInterest in AI (experience in AI and training AI models isn’t a requirement—you’ll learn a lot about that from our team here, but it is a bonus, and you need to have a strong interest and inclination for it)\nWe're hiring across all experience levels — from fresh graduates to junior, senior, and lead software engineers.\n\nNote: this is an in-person role—only open to candidates in Singapore or those willing to relocate.\nAbout the company\nHypotenuse AI\n14,293 followers\nFollow\nSoftware Development 11-50 employees 17 on LinkedIn\nHypotenuse is an AI agent platform for creating, managing, and optimizing your ecommerce product content and data.
