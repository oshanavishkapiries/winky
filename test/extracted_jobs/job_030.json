Our mission is to enable autonomous drones to fly safely, at scale, and with purpose — supporting emergency response, maritime logistics, national security, and more. As Asia-Pacific’s first independent UTM platform provider, we combine software, hardware, and AI to power the next generation of airspace operations. Backed by industry leaders and governments, and with real deployments underway, we’re shaping the future of autonomous systems — and we’re just getting started.\n\nJob scope\nRole Overview\nWe are seeking a talented and highly motivated Software Engineer to join the core development team responsible for building our next-generation Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) platform for a Government customer. You will participate in designing and implementing the critical, highly-automated services that enable safe, scalable, and compliant drone operations in shared airspace.\n This is a backend-heavy role focused on real-time data processing, mission planning, and maintaining a robust system that adheres to aviation safety standards.\n\nKey Responsibilities\nCore UTM Service Development: Design, implement, and maintain high-performance, scalable microservices for core UTM functions, including:\nAirspace Authorization & Compliance: Logic for flight plan validation, geofencing checks, and automated issuance/revocation of flight permissions.\nTraffic Deconfliction: Develop and optimize real-time conflict detection and automated resolution algorithms for multiple concurrent drone operations.\nSurveillance & Tracking: Integrate and process real-time telemetry data (e.g., Remote ID, ADS-B) for accurate positioning and situational awareness.\nAPI & Data Exchange: Develop and maintain robust, high-availability APIs (e.g., REST, gRPC) for third-party integrations and other data-sharing components.\nSystem Reliability & Scalability: Support implementation of distributed system architecture patterns for fault tolerance, high concurrency, and massive scalability to handle national-level drone traffic volume.\nSimulation & Testing: Support the design and building of tools, harnesses, and simulation environments to rigorously test and validate UTM functionalities against complex operational scenarios and safety requirements.\nCompliance & Standards: Ensure all software development adheres to relevant aviation and technical standards.\n Required Qualifications\nEducation: Bachelor's degree or Diploma in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Robotics, or a related field. (Fresh graduates welcomed to apply)\nProgramming: Strong proficiency in at least one backend language suitable for high-performance, concurrent applications (Java, Python, or C++).\nDistributed Systems: Experience designing, building, and deploying scalable applications using AWS cloud infrastructure and containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes).\nAPIs & Data: Deep experience with backend service development, RESTful APIs, and working with modern NoSQL/Relational databases.\nCore Concepts: Solid understanding of concepts critical to drone operations: real-time systems, geo-spatial data processing (GIS), and control loop stability.\n Preferred Qualifications (Nice to Have)\nExperience with geo-spatial libraries (e.g., GDAL, PostGIS, S2 Geometry) and high-volume data streaming technologies (e.g., Kafka).\nKnowledge of aerospace or air traffic management (ATM) principles.\nExperience with mission planning or robotics middleware (e.g., ROS, MAVLink, PX4).\n\nInterested candidates may apply directly to DTC at: https://central.sginnovate.com/hub/marketplace/openings/ea9bdc25-d494-48a2-8e1c-fae391f7f86c\nAbout the company\nSGInnovate\n117,264 followers\nFollow\nVenture Capital and Private Equity Principals 51-200 employees 112 on LinkedIn\nOur Purpose\nTranslating today’s emerging technologies into tomorrow’s opportunities\n\nOur Promise\nWe catalyse innovation, accelerate growth and forge connections to build a thriving Deep Tech economy\n…\nshow more\nShow more",
